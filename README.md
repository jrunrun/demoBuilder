# DemoDataExploder_v5.py

Do you have data that’s interesting, but limited in its ability to support a great demo? If so, then the DemoDataExploder script may be helpful.

Some of the current features, specific to the Inpatient data set are:

•	Extend the dates over 4 years
•	Define volume by weekday, e.g. Monday vs. Tuesday
•	Define YoY growth
•	Create diabetes patients @ specified % of population on monthly basis
•	Define LOS distributions (define unique 80/20 head/tail)
•	Define Readmit flag @ specified % of population on monthly basis
•	Normalize a charge per day, to extend total charges when adjusting Discharge Date
